[00:09.62] Ah! Ah!
[00:13.62] Ah! Ah!
[00:18.33] We come from the land of the ice and snow
[00:20.49] From the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow
[00:23.58] The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new land
[00:31.27] To fight the horde and sing, and cry
[00:35.75] Valhalla, I am coming
[00:40.69] 
[00:44.40] On we sweep with with threshing oar
[00:48.53] Our only goal will be the western shore
[00:53.06] 
[00:56.44] Ah! Ah!
[01:00.56] Ah! Ah!
[01:05.39] We come from the land of the ice and snow
[01:07.28] From the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow
[01:10.60] How soft your fields, so green
[01:14.09] Can whisper tales of gore
[01:17.76] Of how we calmed the tides of war
[01:22.54] We are your overlords
[01:28.52] 
[01:31.49] On we sweep with threshing oar
[01:35.39] Our only goal will be the western shore
[01:39.89] 
[01:43.93] So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
[01:48.40] For peace and trust can win the day, despite of all your losing
[01:51.57]
