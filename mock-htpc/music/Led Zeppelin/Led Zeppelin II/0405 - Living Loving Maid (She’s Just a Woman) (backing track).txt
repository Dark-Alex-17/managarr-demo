With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Livin' lovin' she's just a woman.
Missus cool rides out in her aged cadillac.
Livin' lovin' she's just a woman.

*Come on babe on the round about
Ride on the merry go round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down.

Alimony alimony payin' your bills
Livin' lovin' she's just a woman.
When your conscience hits you knock it back with pills.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

* Tellin' tall (helen told??) tales of how it used to be,
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
With the butler and the maid and the servants three (servantry?).
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman, oh, you got it.
Nobody hears a single word you say.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day.
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

* Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
