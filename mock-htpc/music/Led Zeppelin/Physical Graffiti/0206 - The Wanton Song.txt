Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, have just begun
Left me barely holding on

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one

Oooh, in the darkness can you hear me call
Another day has just begun
Another day

Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheels rolls on
Rolls on
Rolls on
Rolls on, babe
Rolls
