[00:12.42] Let me take you to the movies
[00:18.03] 
[00:21.13] Can I take you to the show?
[00:24.53] Let me be yours ever truly
[00:28.78] Can I make your garden grow?
[00:33.54] 
[00:46.25] From the houses of the holy
[00:52.09] We can watch the white doves go
[00:56.04] From the door comes Satan's daughter
[01:00.29] And it only goes to show, you know
[01:07.60] 
[01:19.77] There's an angel on my shoulder
[01:25.38] In my hand a sword of gold
[01:29.38] Let me wander in your garden
[01:33.30] And the seeds of love I'll sow
[01:37.23] You know
[01:41.06] 
[01:52.58] So the world is spinning faster
[01:56.56] Are you dizzy when you stall?
[02:00.56] Let the music be your master
[02:04.11] Will you heed the master's call
[02:08.64] Oh, Satan and man
[02:16.87] 
[02:24.52] Said there ain't no use in crying
[02:29.37] Cause it will only, only drive you mad
[02:32.81] Does it hurt to hear them lying?
[02:37.05] Was this the only world you had?
[02:41.58] 
[02:55.88] So let me take you, take you to the movie
[03:00.33] Can I take you, baby, to the show?
[03:03.79] Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
[03:07.75] Can I make your garden grow?
[03:11.96] You know, that's right
[03:16.39]
