[00:30.20] It is the springtime of my loving
[00:34.35] 
[00:36.58] The second season I am to know
[00:42.86] You are the sunlight in my growing
[00:48.58] So little warmth I've felt before
[00:55.74] It isn't hard to feel me glowing
[01:01.28] I watched the fire that grew so low
[01:06.81] 
[03:49.92] It is the summer of my smiles
[03:55.45] Flee from me Keepers of the Gloom
[04:01.86] Speak to me only with your eyes
[04:07.61] It is to you I give this tune
[04:13.75] Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
[04:19.56] These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh, oh oh
[04:25.38] 
[05:01.03] Talk
[05:03.89] Talk, talk, talk, talk, hey!
[05:08.67] 
[05:13.04] I've felt the coldness of my winter
[05:18.60] I never thought it would ever go
[05:24.12] I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us
[05:30.34] But I know that I love you so, oh oh
[05:35.79] 
[05:41.28] But I know that I love you so
[05:46.25] These are the seasons of emotion
[05:50.41] 
[05:53.23] And like the winds they rise and fall
[05:59.73] This is the wonder of devotion
[06:04.68] I seek the torch we all must hold
[06:11.55] This is the mystery of the coldest quotient
[06:16.45] Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
[06:23.87] It's just a little rain, oh, oh, ooh, yeah
[06:27.82]
