Ohhh, I can't quit you, baby
So I'm gonna put you down
For a while

I said I can't quit you, baby
I guess I'm gonna have to put you down
For a while

Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yeah, yeah

When you hear me moaning and groaning
You know it hurts me deep down inside

Oh, when you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside

Oh, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are

Oooh
I'll buy you a red carpet for printing
And a diamond ring
No matter how I treat you, baby
I'm not your everything

Aaah, I won't take down, I can't quit you baby
Circumstances are gonna put you down
Go in a ride

But when I pamper you, my little girl
My life, my life is lie
You're my only denial
Yes, you are
Yes, you are
