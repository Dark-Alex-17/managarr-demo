Four Hands(Four Sticks)(Bombay Orchestra)- Led Zeppelin
Oh baby it's cryin' time
Oh baby I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta
Get away from you babe
Oh baby the river's red
Oh baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on
I don't think I can hold out long
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh baby baby when the pines begin to cry
Baby baby baby how do you feel
If the river runs dry baby
How do you feel
Craze baby the rainbow's end
Baby it's just a den
For those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so babe
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh baby baby when the pines begin to cry
Baby baby baby how do you feel
If the river runs dry baby
How do you feel
How do you feel
