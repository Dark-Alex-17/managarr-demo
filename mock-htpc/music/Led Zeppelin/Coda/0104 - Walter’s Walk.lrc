[00:11.77] Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
[00:17.35] Ah, trying hard to change but can't let go
[00:22.75] Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
[00:27.99] Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor
[00:33.07] 
[00:35.20] I'm walking the floor over you
[00:40.10] I'm walking the floor
[00:44.95] 
[00:44.95] Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
[00:48.08] Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
[00:53.71] Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
[00:58.83] Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day
[01:04.01] 
[01:05.19] You know it's hard, I said it's hard
[01:08.23] You know it's true
[01:10.80] I said it's hard, you know it's hard
[01:13.62] Still know it's true
[01:15.06] 
[01:17.75] Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
[01:23.19] When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
[01:28.56] As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
[01:33.95] Can you step aside, does it matter now?
[01:37.52] 
[01:47.15] Every love that's changed, spend it fully
[01:52.68] In the eyes of the night, was it hard to see?
[01:58.22] If it never fails in spite of it all
[02:05.00] So you hide the tears, enter Walter's walk
[02:09.38] 
[02:09.38] You know it is true now
[02:14.56] You know it is true now
[02:16.51] 
[02:53.21] I am walking the floor over you
[02:58.15] I am walking the floor
[03:03.44] 
[03:03.44] Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
[03:08.73] When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
[03:12.81] As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
[03:18.30] Can you step aside, does it matter now?
[03:22.67] 
[03:26.65] Does it matter now?
[03:30.51] Does it, now does it matter?
[03:33.49] Does it matter?
[03:39.06] Ooh yeah
[03:41.74] Ooh yeah
[03:44.18] 
[03:49.23] Ooh, little baby, don't you know
[03:52.66] Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
[04:00.92] Does it matter now?
[04:03.18] Oh yeah
[04:05.54] Oh yes
[04:08.46] Oh yes
[04:14.52]
