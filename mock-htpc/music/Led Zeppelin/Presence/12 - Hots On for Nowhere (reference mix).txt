I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
When i learned how my time had been wasted
And a tear fell as i turned away

Now i've got friends who will give me their shoulder
Event i should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

On the corner of bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So I looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, I lost my way

Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where i'm gonna find it

Hey babe, hey babe
Do you wanna know
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah?
Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
