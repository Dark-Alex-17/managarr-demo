[00:43.25] Dream
[00:46.71] Beyond dreams
[00:51.57] Beyond life
[00:56.02] You will find
[00:59.69] Your
[01:01.63] Song
[01:05.42] Before sound
[01:09.97] To be found
[01:14.59] Close your eyes
[01:18.01] And
[01:20.41] Rise
[01:23.82] Higher still
[01:28.42] Endless thrill
[01:32.90] To the land
[01:36.39] Of
[01:38.76] Love
[01:42.16] Beyond love
[01:46.74] Come alive
[01:51.41] Angel eye
[01:54.47] Forever watching you and I
[01:57.61] You are the night
[01:58.82] You are the ocean
[02:02.04] You are the light behind the cloud
[02:06.84] You are the end and the beginning
[02:11.11] A world where time is not allowed
[02:16.15] There's no such thing as competition
[02:20.48] To find our way we lose control
[02:25.24] Remember love's our only mission
[02:29.67] This is a journey of the soul
[02:34.45] The perfect song is framed with silence
[02:38.99] It speaks of places never seen
[02:43.42] Your home's a promise long forgotten
[02:48.36] It is the birthplace of your dreams
[02:50.45]
