[00:26.39] I didn't want to be the one to forget
[00:30.76] I thought of everything I'd never regret
[00:34.93] A little time with you is all that I get
[00:39.33] That's all we need because it's all we can take
[00:43.75] One thing I never see the same when your 'round
[00:48.10] I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
[00:52.41] I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
[00:56.84] But no one gives us any time anymore
[01:01.20] He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
[01:05.64] You made an offer for it, then you ran off
[01:10.02] I got this picture of us, gets in my head
[01:14.37] And all I hear is the last thing that you said
[01:18.32] "I listened to your problems
[01:20.53] Now listen to mine"
[01:22.12] I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
[01:27.63] And we will never be alone again
[01:30.21] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[01:32.44] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[01:34.68] Can I give it up or give it away?
[01:36.80] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[01:39.08] But I never really know where to go
[01:41.28] So I chained myself to a friend
[01:43.45] 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
[01:45.64] And we will never be alone again
[01:47.79] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[01:49.94] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[01:52.11] Can I give it up or give it away?
[01:54.39] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[01:56.45] But I never really know where to go
[01:58.62] So I chained myself to a friend
[02:01.52] Some more again
[02:06.88] 
[02:11.04] It didn't matter what they wanted to see
[02:15.29] He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
[02:19.84] That summer memory that just never dies
[02:24.18] We worked too long and hard to give it no time
[02:28.54] He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
[02:32.95] Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
[02:37.29] He runs his scissors at the seem in the wall
[02:41.59] He cannot break it down or else he would fall
[02:45.95] One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
[02:54.54] Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
[03:04.06] 
[03:20.41] "I listened to your problems
[03:22.73] Now listen to mine"
[03:24.46] I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
[03:29.85] And we will never be alone again
[03:32.45] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[03:34.30] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[03:36.86] Can I give it up or give it away?
[03:38.80] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[03:41.19] But I never really know where to go
[03:43.36] So I chained myself to a friend
[03:45.68] 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
[03:47.37] And we will never be alone again
[03:50.02] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[03:52.02] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[03:54.37] Can I give it up or give it away?
[03:56.56] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[03:58.64] But I never really know where to go
[04:00.86] So I chained myself to a friend
[04:03.01] 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
[04:04.26] I don't understand, don't get upset
[04:09.88] I'm not with you
[04:12.96] We're swimming around
[04:16.35] It's all I do, when I'm with you
[04:22.34] And we will never be alone again
[04:24.74] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[04:26.90] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[04:29.08] Can I give it up or give it away?
[04:31.34] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[04:33.39] But I never really know where to go
[04:35.63] So I chained myself to a friend
[04:37.58] 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
[04:40.01] And we will never be alone again
[04:42.16] 'Cause it doesn't happen every day
[04:44.35] Kinda counted on you being a friend
[04:46.46] Can I give it up or give it away?
[04:48.72] Now I thought about what I wanna say
[04:50.95] But I never really know where to go
[04:53.13] So I chained myself to a friend
[04:55.23] 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
