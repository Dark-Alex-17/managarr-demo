[00:09.14] You are
[00:11.69] Face to face now
[00:15.59] Face to face
[00:17.45] You are
[00:19.84] Face to face now
[00:23.41] With me
[00:25.73] You are
[00:28.06] Face to face now
[00:31.85] Face to face
[00:33.95] You are
[00:36.00] Face to face now
[00:39.77] With me
[00:43.60] You are
[00:47.49] Dancing
[00:52.06] You are
[00:55.68] Dancing
[00:58.27] You are
[01:00.52] Face to face now
[01:04.43] Face to face
[01:06.47] You are
[01:08.76] Face to face now
[01:12.24] With me
[01:13.37] What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
[01:17.41] It's not your fault I was being too demanding
[01:21.86] I must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
[01:25.88] All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
[01:31.26] There's not much I know about you
[01:35.15] Fear will always make you blind
[01:39.13] But the answer is in clear view
[01:43.44] It's amazing what you'll find face to face
[01:46.90] You are
[01:49.38] Face to face now
[01:53.34] Face to face
[01:55.19] You are
[01:57.43] Face to face now
[02:01.28] With me
[02:03.31] You are
[02:05.46] Face to face now
[02:09.55] Face to face
[02:11.36] You are
[02:13.72] Face to face now
[02:17.55] With me
[02:18.63] I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
[02:22.62] Tried to forget, until I hit the bottom
[02:26.84] But when I faced you in my blank confusion
[02:30.60] I realised you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion
[02:36.50] It really didn't make sense
[02:40.31] Just to leave this unresolved
[02:44.32] It's not hard to go the distance
[02:48.63] When you finally get involved face to face
[02:52.49] You are
[02:54.58] Face to face now
[02:58.37] Face to face
[03:00.45] You are
[03:02.60] Face to face now
[03:06.03] With me
[03:10.14] You are
[03:14.06] Dancing
[03:18.49] You are
[03:22.28] Dancing
[03:24.90] You are
[03:27.19] Face to face now
[03:31.16] Face to face
[03:33.14] You are
[03:35.19] Face to face now
[03:39.29] With me
[03:41.63] It really didn't make sense
[03:45.40] Just to leave this unresolved
[03:49.46] It's not hard to go the distance
[03:53.69] When you finally get involved face to face
[03:57.97]
