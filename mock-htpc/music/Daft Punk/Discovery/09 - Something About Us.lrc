[01:17.45] It might not be the right time
[01:22.10] I might not be the right one
[01:25.82] But there's something about us I want to say
[01:30.42] 'Cause there's something between us anyway
[01:36.25] I might not be the right one
[01:41.12] It might not be the right time
[01:45.16] But there's something about us I've got to do
[01:50.40] Some kind of secret I will share with you
[01:55.69] I need you more than anything in my life
[02:00.45] I want you more than anything in my life
[02:05.38] I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
[02:10.00] I love you more than anyone in my life.
