No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
Ooh, no mercy from me
Tell no truth and tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
Oh, inject your venom, it'll be your last attack, ow
Oh, no mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
V-E-N-O-M
Got no heart, no, feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain, yeah
Come choose your victim, take him by surprise
Go in hard and get him right between the eyes
And inject the venom (ow)
Inject the venom (c'mon)
Inject the venom (c'mon)
Inject it all (ow)
Ooh, stick it in
Stick it
Oh, yeah
Yeah, that's all
C'mon, inject the venom (ooh)
Inject the venom
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Yeah
Inject the venom (get it all)
Inject the venom (oh)
Inject the venom (ooh)
Inject it all
Oh, inject the venom
