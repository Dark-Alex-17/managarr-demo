Black shadow hangin' over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison runnin' through your veins
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
Black widow weavin' evil notions
Dark secrets bein' spun in your web
Good men goin' down in your ocean
They can't swim 'cause they're tied to your bed
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom
Oh, black widow
C'mon, weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got 'em tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you (evil talks)
Evil talks around you (yeah, evil walks)
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks
You're so bad
