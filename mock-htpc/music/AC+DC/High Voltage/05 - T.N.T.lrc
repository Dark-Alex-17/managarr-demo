[00:16.11] Oi, oi, oi, oi
[00:19.62] Oi, oi, oi
[00:21.70] 
[00:21.74] See me ride out of the sunset
[00:25.74] On your color TV screen
[00:30.91] Out for all that I can get
[00:35.15] If you know what I mean
[00:37.02] 
[00:38.09] Women to the left of me
[00:42.13] And women to the right
[00:46.16] Ain't got no gun, ain't got no knife
[00:49.65] Don't you start no fight
[00:51.85] 
[00:54.79] 'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
[00:59.22] T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
[01:03.06] T.N.T. I'm a power load
[01:06.87] T.N.T. watch me explode!
[01:14.14] 
[01:20.85] I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
[01:25.36] I'm a wanted man
[01:29.10] Public enemy number one
[01:33.47] Understand?
[01:34.71] 
[01:36.13] So, lock up your daughter, lock up your wife
[01:39.90] Lock up your back door, run for your life
[01:44.07] The man is back in town
[01:47.85] So, don't you mess me around
[01:51.66] 
[01:52.82] 'Cause I'm T.N.T. I'm dynamite
[01:57.10] T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
[02:00.95] T.N.T. I'm a power load
[02:04.91] T.N.T. watch me explode
[02:12.18] 
[02:28.77] T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
[02:32.21] T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
[02:36.16] T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
[02:39.98] T.N.T. oi, oi, oi
[02:43.59] 
[02:43.69] T.N.T. I'm dynamite
[02:47.47] T.N.T. and I'll win the fight
[02:51.10] T.N.T. I'm a power load
[02:55.13] T.N.T. watch me explode
