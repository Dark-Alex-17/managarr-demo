Yeah
Ooh, definitely, ow (?)
Yeah-yeah
Oooh-ow
Heroes, hard to find
Don't make the news till they're doin' time
Schemers turn the screw
They get the word and they drop on you
Lay down the law, black of the night
Run up a score, ooh, the vice is right
Dealers lookin' 'round, wheel is turnin' 'round
Comin' 'round on you
Yeah
Some sin for gold
Some sin for shame
Some sin for cash
Some sin for gain
Some sin for wine
Some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothin', no
Nothin' at all
Nero, evil mind
He was born way before his time
Lead on, down below
You get it right and away you go
You gotta lay down the rules, push up the price
Turn on the heat, put you on ice
Dealers lookin' 'round, wheel is turnin' 'round
Comin' 'round for you, ooh
Some sin for gold
Some sin for shame
Some sin for cash
Some sin for gain
Some sin for wine
Some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothin', yeah
Gimme the finger, yeah
Yeah
You left it all down (?)
Yeah
Ooh
Oh, some sin for gold
Some sin for shame
Some sin for cash
Some sin for gain
Some sin for wine
Some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothin' (some sin)
Ain't gonna sin for nothin', yeah (some sin)
You get nothin' for nothin', no (some sin)
Ain't gonna sin for nothin'
That don't make no sense
No, no
