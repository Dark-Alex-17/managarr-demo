Highball women that are hot
To touch
Legs do the talkin' spellin'
Out the lust
See the Sugar Daddies with a
Sweet tooth and a smile
See what's hangin' off him
Like a want'n child
That's where you'll find me
Standing proud
[Chorus]
Playing with girls gonna get
You hot
Playing with guns gonna get
You shot
Playing with fire gonna heat
You up
Playing with me you're gonna
Get the lot
Bring on the showgirls and
The debutantes
Late-night waitress in a
Restaurant
Headin' for the clubs and
Bars with the flashin'
Lights
Lookin' for the good-time
Girls in their black nylon
Tights
Over the barrel bottoms-up
[Chorus]
Oooh river run dry
Yeah playing with fire
Oooh wild sweet child
Playing with girls
Playing with girls
I like tall girls and I'll
Take 'em small
I want 'em all up front I
Like 'em all
I want to see 'em strut their
Stuff
And lose their social grace
You play your cards right
And you'll deal yourself an
Ace
That's where you'll find me
Standing proud
Playing with girls
