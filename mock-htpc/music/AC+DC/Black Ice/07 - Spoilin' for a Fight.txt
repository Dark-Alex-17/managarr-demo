I see trouble coming man,
Well I'm coming back to a fork,
Sliding down a road,
Gonna lick 'em on down,
We're gonna run right out,
I'm a fighting fool,
And I'm hungry for you,
Well I'm living on a line,
I'm protecting my life,
Rock with me, come on come one,
You're only spoilin' for a fight,
Spoilin' for a fight [Repeat: x5]
Make your heart beat thump,
Make your starter jump,
You're running on time,
Then you're fighting all night,
With my rocking shoes,
Cause I'm hungry for you,
Well I'm living on the line,
All my life, rock with me,
Come on come on, you want it
[Chorus]
Spoilin' for a fight,
Spoilin' for a fight,
Tryin' to make it right,
Spoilin' for a fight,
Spoilin' for a fight,
Trying to make it right,
You better stand your ground,
And keep out of my town,
To live another day,
[Chorus]
Fighting all night,
Cause I'm spoilin' for a fight
