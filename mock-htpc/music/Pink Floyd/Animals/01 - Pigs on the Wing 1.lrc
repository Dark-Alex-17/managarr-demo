[00:17.79] You know that I care
[00:26.88] What happens to you
[00:40.37] 
[00:43.47] And I know that you care
[00:45.65] For me too
[00:46.40] So, I don't feel alone on the weight of the stone
[00:47.23] Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
[00:59.74] And any fool knows a dog needs a home
[01:12.37] A shelter from pigs on the wing
[01:18.19]
