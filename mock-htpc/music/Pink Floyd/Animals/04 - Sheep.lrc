[01:41.82] Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
[01:48.89] 
[02:03.83] Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
[02:12.68] 
[02:26.93] You better watch out
[02:30.59] There may be dogs about
[02:33.34] I've looked over Jordan, I have seen
[02:38.51] Things are not what they seem
[02:42.61] 
[02:48.12] What do you get for pretending the danger's not real?
[02:54.41] 
[03:10.53] Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
[03:13.99] Down well trodden corridors, into the valley of steel
[03:19.83] 
[03:32.98] What a surprise!
[03:36.35] A look of terminal shock in your eyes
[03:40.10] Now things are really what they seem
[03:43.74] No, this is not a bad dream
[03:47.97] 
[06:26.07] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
[06:29.96] He makes me down to lie
[06:32.35] Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
[06:37.54] With bright knives He releaseth my soul
[06:41.66] He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
[06:45.75] He converteth me to lamb cutlets
[06:49.40] For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
[06:53.47] When cometh the day we lowly ones
[06:56.57] Through quiet reflection and great dedication master the art of karate
[07:02.51] Lo, we shall rise up and then we'll make the bugger's eyes water
[07:09.89] Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
[07:17.14] 
[07:23.85] Yeah, ha-ha-ha
[07:28.60] 
[07:31.12] Wave upon wave of demented avengers
[07:34.54] March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
[07:39.96] 
[07:52.01] Have you heard the news?
[07:55.88] The dogs are dead
[07:59.79] You better stay home and do as you're told
[08:03.30] Get out of the road if you wanna grow old
[08:05.85]
