[00:17.77] You know that I care
[00:26.88] What happens to you
[00:40.37] 
[00:43.40] And I know that you care
[00:45.64] For me too
[00:46.40] So, I don't feel alone on the weight of the stone
[00:47.27] Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
[00:59.76] And any fool knows a dog needs a home
[01:12.38] A shelter from pigs on the wing
[01:18.17]
