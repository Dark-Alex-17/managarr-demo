Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening and welcome to Earl's Court.
My name is Gary Yudman and we are going to have a fine show this evening.
Well, we'd like to thank you for your patience in waiting.
The stage is set and the band is about ready to begin, I think.
No, not quite yet.
Well, this will afford me the opportunity to remind you...
