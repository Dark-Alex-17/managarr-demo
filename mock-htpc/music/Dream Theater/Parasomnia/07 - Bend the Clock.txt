Worn down, wearing thin
Hellish dreams, tormenting scenes
Shadows looming
I'm paralyzed, can't move
Scared and confused
If I, if I could bend the clock
The passageway of time
Leave it all behind
No more, no more paralyzing dreams
The midnight screams always haunting me
But I sink deeper each day
Cold, hallowed place
Dark shadows, vast haunting landscapes
In a frantic state
Tired of feeling lost, alone and out of place
This circle I can't break
Every night, lie comatose
But wide awake
I'm paralyzed again
Darkness creeping in
If I, if I could bend the clock
The passageway of time
Leave it all behind
No more, no more paralyzing dreams
The midnight screams always haunting me
But I sink further today
The witching hour begins
Can't escape, I find myself again
Prisoner in the end
Sinking further than I've ever been
And if I, if I could bend the clock
The passageway of time
A better place I'd find
And no more, no more paralyzing dreams
The midnight screams break this hold on me
But I can't get away
Can't find my way
Sinking further every day
