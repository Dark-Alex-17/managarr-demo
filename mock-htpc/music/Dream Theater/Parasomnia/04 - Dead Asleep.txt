In a waterside village
In the heat of July
A man and his wife settled down for the night
In the morning, he woke to a horrible sight
It's all just so tragic, an unusual case
The violent result of a fatal mistake
How can he be to blame?
He was never awake
Wake up
What have I done?
I was dead asleep
Wake up
Can you send someone?
I'm not insane, I was dead asleep
Scrambling in the darkness, in fear for his life
Certain a killer broke in
He fumbles for a weapon, reaches for a knife
A sleepwalking murder begins
It was a vivid encounter, a realistic fight
And now he's got blood on his hands
He stands over the body, sees it's his wife
A nightmare he can't understand
I must confess, it was me
I needed to silence the screams
She suffered a brutal attack
A shockingly violent act
Wake up
What have I done?
I was dead asleep
Wake up
Can you send someone?
I'm not insane, I was dead asleep
Out of my mind, out of my body
Someone's been killed, I am sorry
Out of control, all out of answers
Maybe one day you'll forgive me
Wake up
What have I done?
I was dead asleep
I must have been dreaming
I have no memory of anything
We strongly suspect you're feeling a sense of despair
No one knows of the guilt that you bear
In the eyes of the law, you are free
You are innocent
