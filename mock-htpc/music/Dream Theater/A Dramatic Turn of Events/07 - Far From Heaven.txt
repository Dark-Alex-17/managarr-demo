No one truly has the answers
Every day I struggle through it once more
Keep things bottled up, never speaking my mind
Misinterpreted, I'm doing just fine
Every day I put a brave face on
Serves me well
Feeling helpless, facing it alone
Hard to tell that I can change who I am
How I feel
There's no end
I have done what you asked of me
Leaves me nothing to live for
Coming undone
Way too high a price I should pay
You keep your pride
While I die inside every day
No, I can't lie anymore
Won't pretend I've done all I can
You can't imagine the hell I'm going through
Not asking you to save me
I'm too far from heaven
Nothing you can do to change me
but accept me as I am
