[00:46.77] Standing in the darkness
[00:49.07] Waiting for the light
[00:51.57] The smell of pure adrenaline
[00:54.02] Burning in the night
[00:56.54] Random blinding flashes
[00:58.82] Aiming at the stage
[01:01.38] Intro tape begins to roll
[01:04.91] Igniting sonic rage
[01:07.26] Still they keep me between these hollow walls
[01:12.68] Hoping to find in me
[01:14.34] The answers to the test that stumped them all
[01:27.29] "The boy is just simply crazy
[01:28.95] Suffering from delusions
[01:31.06] We honestly think that maybe
[01:32.72] He might need an institution
[01:34.59] He lives in a world of fiction
[01:36.68] And really could use some help
[01:38.20] We have just the place to fix him
[01:40.22] To save him from himself"
[01:51.90] Curled up in the darkness
[01:54.02] Searching for the light
[01:56.80] The smell of stale sweat and shit
[01:59.27] Steaming through the night
[02:01.72] Random urine testing
[02:03.83] Pills red, pink and blue
[02:06.35] Counseling and therapy
[02:09.60] Providing not a clue
[02:12.41] Still they keep me between these hollow walls
[02:17.25] Hoping to find in me
[02:19.01] The answers to the test that stumped them all
[02:32.44] "We can't seem to find the answers
[02:34.13] He seemed such a clear cut case
[02:36.08] We cannot just let him leave here
[02:38.31] And put all this work to waste
[02:39.54] Why don't we try shock treatment
[02:41.42] It really might do some help
[02:43.13] We have just the tools to fix him
[02:45.01] To save him from himself"
