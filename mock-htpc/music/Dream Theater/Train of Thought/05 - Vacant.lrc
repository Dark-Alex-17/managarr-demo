[00:39.38] Hey you, hey you
[00:48.61] I'm right here
[00:56.15] Conscience fading
[01:05.24] Can't get through
[01:12.50] Oh Lord
[01:16.94] Helpless
[01:21.00] Confused
[01:29.17] Head swayed,
[01:32.35] Eyes glazed,
[01:36.99] And mine teared
[01:45.12] She's losing control
[01:52.63] What can I do?
[01:59.05] Her vacant eyes
[02:04.21] Black holes
[02:09.02] Am I losing you?
