[00:00.05] If I still had something left
[00:09.55] I'd surely use my gift
[00:15.38] To give her one more breath
[00:21.12] To see her smile again
[00:27.02] And yet, my gift is gone
[00:32.93] Along with all her dreams
[00:38.78] It vanished with a scream
[00:44.63] My fragile voice has all but disappeared
[00:53.00] I've nothing left to give
[00:59.42] The words I wish I'd said
[01:04.84] Just whispers on the wind
[01:11.08] And now all hope is dead
[01:17.07]
