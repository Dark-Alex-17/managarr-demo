What will you have me do, Caesar?
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die
I will empower you, to one end alone
To give power back to the people of Rome and end the corruption that has crippled it
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no
Maximus, that is why it must be you
