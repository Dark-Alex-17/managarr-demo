What would you have me do, Ceaser?
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die
I will empower you
to one end alone
to give power back
to the people of Rome
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.
Will you accept this great honour
that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no.
Maximus,
that is why it must be you.
