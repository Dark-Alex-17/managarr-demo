Ruthless winds, raging seas,
Who have stolen my true love
Davy Jones of the Seven Seas
Oh, bring him back to me.

Everyday and every night,
Locked in darkness, all alone
Many tears, my love, I have shed
Hoping you would come.

Oh, my sweet Davy Jones
Time has come for you to return
Please come back to me my love
My beloved Davy Jones.

All these years oh, my sweet Godess
Bound to sail these wretched seas
I have always thought of you
Oh, my dear Calypso.

Now when I can step on land
And feel the touch of the burning sand
When my path to you is clear
I fear my end is near.

D.J:
You a goddess.
C: And you a sailor.

Both: Cursed to be always apart
Yet our love shall last forever
Until the end of all. INSTRUMENTAL
