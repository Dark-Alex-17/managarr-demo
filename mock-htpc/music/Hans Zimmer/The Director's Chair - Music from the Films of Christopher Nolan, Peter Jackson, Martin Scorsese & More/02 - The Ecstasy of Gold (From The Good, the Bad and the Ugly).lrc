I will love you
From now until the end of time
Let me guide you
From everywhere and every ride
Let me love you
Every day for the rest of my whole life
Bigger than the ocean
Even endless
An endless pressure
Dancing inside you
Inside you and me

Your smile and your touch
Forever will never belong
My heart's desire
Burns for you like the moon and the sun

I love you
