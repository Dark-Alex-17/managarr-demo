Last night I had a dream
About a home that was so bright
I don't know why
It has to be a dream

Why can't I, where will I
God help me
Help me find a home

Keep your eyes on the prize
Don't be dismayed
Don't be dismayed
Deep in your heart
You must believe
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright, someday

Sometimes it's hard
And sometimes it's cold
Sometimes I'm in
Sometimes I'm out
No, I haven't had much to eat
Lord knows, I haven't had much sleep

Keep your eyes on the prize
Don't be dismayed
Don't be dismayed
Deep in your heart
You must believe
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright, someday

We shall overcome
We shall overcome
Everything is gonna be alright, someday
