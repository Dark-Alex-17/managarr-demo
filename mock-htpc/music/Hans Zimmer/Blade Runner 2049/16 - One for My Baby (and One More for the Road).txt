It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So, set 'em up, Joe, I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad, wish you'd make the music easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me?
'Til it's all talked away

Well, that's how it goes and Joe
I know you're gettin' anxious to close
So, thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
But this torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode
So, make it one for my baby and one more for the road

The long, it's so long
The long, very long
